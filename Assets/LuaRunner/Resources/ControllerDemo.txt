-- The API Bridge allows you're Lua game to talk to the core PV8 APIs
local apiBridge = LuaBridge()

-- Before we can display the input, we'll want to track each button state. These Boolean Arrays will 
-- help us track if each button is down (false) or up (true).
local player1States = {}
local player2States = {}

-- We'll use these values to help lay out the button state text.
local pos = {x = 1, y = 3, xOffset = 10}

-- Pixel Vision 8 supports 8 unique buttons: Up, Down, Left, Right, A, B, Select and Start.
local totalButtons = 8

-- The Init() method is part of the game's lifecycle and called a game starts. We are going to
-- use this method to configure background color, ScreenBufferChip and draw some text to the display.
function Init()

	-- Before we start, we need to set a background color and rebuild the ScreenBufferChip. The screen buffer
	-- allows us to draw our fonts into the background layer to save on draw calls.
	apiBridge:ChangeBackgroundColor(32)
	apiBridge:RebuildScreenBuffer()

	-- We need to display some default text for our demo explaining what is going on. This text will just be 
	-- drawn into the screen buffer.
	apiBridge:DrawFontToBuffer("CONTROLLER TEST", pos.x , pos.y - 2, "large-font", 0)
	local text = "    UP:\n  DOWN:\n RIGHT:\n  LEFT:\n     A:\n     B:\nSELECT:\n START:\n"
	apiBridge:DrawFontToBuffer("PLAYER ONE\n"..text, pos.x, pos.y, "small-font", -4)
	apiBridge:DrawFontToBuffer("PLAYER TWO\n"..text, pos.x + pos.xOffset, pos.y, "small-font", -4)

-- The Update() method is part of the game's life cycle. The engine
-- calls Update() on every frame before the Draw() method. It accepts
-- one argument, timeDelta, which is the difference in milliseconds
-- since the last frame. We are going to track each player's button state.
function Update()
	
	-- We'll need to loop through each of the buttons. We can use the totalButtons to limit the for loop and
	-- we'll move through each controller's button states at the same time.
	for i=1,totalButtons do

		-- The ButtonDown() method returns true when a button is down and false if the player is not pressing it.
		-- We'll save this value into our player1States and player2States Arrays.
		player1States[i] = apiBridge:ButtonDown(i-1, 0)
		player2States[i] = apiBridge:ButtonDown(i-1, 1)

	end

end

-- The Draw() method is part of the game's life cycle. It is called after Update() and
-- is where all of our draw calls should go. We'll be using this to render font characters to the display.
function Draw()

	-- It's important to clear the display on each frame. There are two ways to do this. Here 
	-- we are going to use the DrawScreenBuffer() way to copy over the existing buffer and clear
	-- all of the previous pixel data.
	apiBridge:DrawScreenBuffer()

	-- This resets the x and y values we use to draw the fonts to the display.
	local x = 0
	local y = 0

	-- In this loop, we set up the X and Y positions for our text then draw the font to the display to show the
	-- current state of each button.
	for i=1,totalButtons do
		x = (pos.x + 8) * 4
		y = (( i + pos.y) * 8) + pos.y 
		apiBridge:DrawFont(player1States[i] == true and "1" or "0", x, y - 3, "small-font", -4)
	end

	-- We'll do the same thing for player two but adjust for the text being in the second column by adding the xOffset the x value.
	for i=1,totalButtons do
		x = (pos.x + (pos.xOffset * 2) + 8) * 4
		y = (( i + pos.y) * 8) + pos.y 
		apiBridge:DrawFont(player2States[i] == true and "1" or "0", x, y - 3, "small-font", -4)
	end
